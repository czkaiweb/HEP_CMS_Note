CRAB is a a utility to submit CMSSW jobs to distributed computing resources. By using CRAB you will be able to:

1. Access CMS data and Monte-Carlo which are distributed to CMS aligned centres worldwide.
2. Exploit the CPU and storage resources at CMS aligned centres. 

A deteiled description can be found in: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideCrab#CRAB3_documentation

In this document, following contents will be covered:
1. Commands to run, monitor and control jobs via CRAB
2. Building your own CRAB configuration file for MC generating and analysis

The usual way to submit jobs via CRAB follows the way:

1.Setuping up the environment to make CRAB3 available
2.Prepare the configuration files which tell CRAB3 what to do
3.Run CRAB3 to submit and control the jobs.


Before we can run anything with CRAB, we should start by configuring the enrivonment to use CRAB3,
If you are working on any site with CVMFS, CRAB3 would be ready to use. 
A quick way to do that is:

  $source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/crab3/crab.sh # or crab.csh, based on your shell

Also you should have the authority to submitting jobs, 
  
  $voms-proxy-init --voms cms

please check: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookCRAB3Tutorial#Get_a_CMS_VO_proxy

Typically, we want CRAB3 sending a cfg file, which describes the thread for MC generating or analysis, to remote sites. We will talk about cfg file in configuration part.
Just like sending a postman for delivering, you should tell him when, where, to whom and some personalized details.
We also need a script to tell CRAB3 how to handle the delivering.

Please check twiki page: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/CRAB3ConfigurationFile which descibe arguments and the script to translate CRAB2 config into a CRAB3 one.
